# Bricks Bucket: Localization

>**IMPORTANT NOTICE**
>
>This repository is part of the [Bricks Bucket project](https://github.com/javier-games/upm-bricks-bucket) and it's development halted since 2019. This package remains publicly archived as a reference and includes valuable C# Enums based on international standards. We recommend using the official [Unity Localization package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.localization@latest) for a fully supported solution.

## Overview

This unfinished Unity package provides a set of C# Enums that implement widely used international standards relevant to localization. While the project itself is no longer under development, these Enums may serve as useful resources for developers working with location-based data. The package includes:

- **ISO 15924**: Defines script codes (e.g., Latin, Cyrillic) used in text encoding.
- **ISO 639**: Specifies language codes, such as `en` for English, `fr` for French, etc.
- **ISO 3166**: Defines country codes (e.g., `US` for the United States, `JP` for Japan).
- **UN M49**: Provides region codes to represent global regions, such as continents or subregions.

These standards enable a unified approach to handling languages, scripts, and regional identifiers, making them particularly useful for localization workflows.
